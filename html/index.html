            <h2>About me</h2>
            <p>My name is Steven Carroll.  I am a Senior in Brigham Young University's Computer Science undergraduate program.  I enjoy programming and solving problems.  I love exploring new technologies and learning new skills.  I have a fair amount of experience in Java, C, and C++ from classes that I have taken and from my own personal learning.  I have some experience in web programming, focusing mainly on PHP, using the CakePHP framework.  I have worked with RESTful web services and SQL datasources.  My love for programming started early on in my education.  In middle school, my father gave me a Visual Basic book, and I started trying to learn and play around with it on my own.  In high school, he gave me a couple Java books, and I picked up some valuable fundamentals from reading and programming from them.</p>
